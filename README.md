# Electron-ledger
This is the sample I am building at local machine (my old vaio)


1) install node.js - get the installer for your machine 
2) get npm - node-package-manager

3) get electron -> npm install --save-dev electron

4) see the "dependencies" in the package.json  -> npm install --save "depenency"
5) get the ("dev-dependencies") in the package.json -> npm install --save-dev "dev-dependenvcy"


6) Run the  start script -> npm start


NOTE: For Windows you need  to have Visual Studio and v140+ compile tools ... 
Weird but so much big size tool is what stated compiling on my pc
