# Electron-ledger
This is the sample I am building at local machine

Author/Developer -> Bhaskar Taneja



1) install node.js - get the installer for your machine 
2) get npm - node-package-manager

3) get electron -> npm install --save-dev electron

4) see the "dependencies" in the package.json  -> npm install --save "depenency"
5) get the ("dev-dependencies") in the package.json -> npm install --save-dev "dev-dependenvcy"

6) For dev-dependencies to work C++ compiler tools are necessary

NOTE: For Windows you need  to have Visual Studio and v140+ compile tools ... 
Weird but so much big size tool is what started compiling on my pc 



7) Run the  start script -> npm start
